# Overall Project Completion

Unlike many other groups, our project is a fully autonomous SimCity, which we are incredibly proud of. 
Not only that, but we have implemented a method involving arraylists and stoplights to completely avoid collisions with vehicles within the city (This can be tested with a button in our Gui)
Currently, our SimCity will run through each day over and over again autonomously deciding what to do.
+ Here are a list of some, but not all, of the most notable actions that a person can do throughout the day.
1. Choice between going to restaurant or eating at home
2. Idling at home (And doing various actions such as playing fussball, reading, watching T.V. etc.) 
3. Waking up and Doing Morning Actions as well as going to sleep.
4. Buying a car if they do not have a car and have money.
5. Withdrawing, depositing, or requesting a loan from the bank.
6. Going to work places either on feet or on car (if they have it).

+ So far, all of these actions will work and show up within either the main gui or the individual guis.

+ Here are a list of some of the features that are working, but not implemented fully for V1
1. People Riding the Bus (working but not implemented)
2. RepairMan for Housing (working but not implemented)
3. Special Waiter (working but not implemented)
4. Apartment Complex (Working but not implemented).
5. Renter and Owner Interaction (Working but not implemented)

+ Here are a list of some, but not all, of the new features we will add for V2
1. Robbers robbing the bank
2. More houses, More Restaurants, and More Buildings
3. A* within the individual buildings
4. Buying food from the market to cook at home.
5. Adding People directly into the City (we only have it partially ready)
6. Collision detection for pedestrians (We have it halfway setup)
7. Better graphical animation and images

We are not limited to the above, but these are some of the things that we will be sure to do first. We will of course finish all of V2 requirements in the end.

# How To Use Our SimCity

Our SimCity runs autonomously. As a result, there is no configuration Panel.
However, there is a config.txt located in the src folder (src/config.txt) that allows for creations of people. 
Every single person will have certain roles (such as

+ I (Wayne Chi, the Team Leader) believe that, although there were differences in skill level, everyone gave 200%  to this project (The extra hundred percent being derived from our sleep) and did an approximately equal amount of work.
+ Not only that, but the roles and contributions we have are loosely defined as we all helped each other out throughout the project, with most people fixing and editing code from all throughout the project.
