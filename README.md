CSCI201 - Team30
======

This project features a fully functioning restaurant, market, bank, and home. In addition, it features a city GUI with collision prevention and path determination.

To enter a building, simply boot up the application and select one of the buildings. This should adjust the bottom left panel of your screen
to show what is occurring inside the building. 

On the bottom right section of the screen, we have provided several features. You can add a person to the city, and you can also add fake vehicles to demonstrate how
the city handles pathing and collision detection.
