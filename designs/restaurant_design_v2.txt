===============Requirements==============
Excess money must be deposited in a Bank
The restaurant must have working capital for the day
Workers in the restaurant are paid

================Assumption===============
Both working capital and bank balance could be negative:
Working capital is like a credit card with some pre deposit. (it gets turned into negative when cashier doesn’t have enough money pay the market)
Bank balance is like a bank account, a negative bank balance means there’s a loan

At the end of a day, cashier first calculate the total amount he needs to pay workers, then add the minimum working capital (500) to it and get a number N.
If current working capital > N, pay workers and deposit the excess money
If current working capital < N but (bank balance + current working capital) >= N,
	Withdraw and pay
If current working capital < N and (bank balance + current working capital) < N,
	Withdraw all the money, Request a loan from bank,
	If loan is granted (msgGrantALoan), pay workers
	If loan is refused (msgRefuseALoan), DOES NOT pay workers and deposit excess money if there is any
